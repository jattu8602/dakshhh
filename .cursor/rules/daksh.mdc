# we have to make a landing page in / route and /dashboard route
# I have added a .env file in root for super admin email pass so use that for loginning the super admin . After login open /dashboard route let the session store till logout
# use firestore : super admin can add the schools (take school id , name , school mail, mobile number  and will add more in future ) . super admin can add multiple schools and can see the list in /dashboard  . admin can search the schools too for easy access (by entering the school name or school id)
# now after creating the school: super admin can add the multiple classes (class name (like 3rd, 5thA),no. of students(editable later), starting rollnumber(like AD23 or 45)(default 1) and ending roll no(like AD50 or 67))
# inside class super admin can add( auto increment roll no, student name ,password autogenerated, qr code autogenerated , username(autogenerate) follow pattern - (make it unique it based on his name ,rollnumber,class, school))


# i will use this data to login the student in app via usename pass , or qr code password

# in root i have firebase.txt already so use it
